## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important instructions!!

Because of the structure of the CSV File provided by Bradesco, to import the transactions you'll need to use the OFX file instead.

But how? It's simple! Just convert into a CSV using this [website] I found (https://detonix.com.br/ofx/ofx-csv) or any other that does the same job.

After that, use the Converted CSV file! ü§ì
