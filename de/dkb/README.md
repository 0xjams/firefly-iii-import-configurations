# DKB

There are a few things you have to be aware of while working with DKB and Firefly III.

1. CSV files generated by DKB don't use UTF-8. You need to convert to UTF-8 before using the CSV Importer. For example, on Windows you can do this with Notepad++ (*Encoding &rightarrow; Convert to UTF-8*).

2. You need to remove the first few lines (usually the first 6) of the CSV file. They only contain information about your account and because the number of delimiters does not match the number of the following lines, the CSV Importer will throw an error (besides the fact that importing account information makes no sense). So make sure you only have a single header line (usually starts with `Buchungstag`).

3. You need to remove your credit card bill transaction from either your checking account CSV or your credit card CSV. Otherwise the transfer will be imported twice into Firefly III.

4. You should remove the fake transaction labelled `Abschluss`. It appears on the first of every month and only displays the current account balance. Because the format is not a valid transaction, the CSV importer will throw an error on this line. This is optional because the error does not do any harm besides showing up.

5. You may wish to set `skip_form` to `true` in your local copy of the configurations to skip a few clicks. By default the form is presented so that you can double-check the configuration before you perform your first import.

## Automation

If you wish to automate steps 1-4, have a look at [Firefly III DKB CSV Fixer](https://github.com/MadWalnut/firefly-iii-dkb-csv-fix). It can apply all needed changes to your CSV file with a single command or click.
