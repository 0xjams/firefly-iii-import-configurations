Import configurations for Firefly III

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you add a configuration file to the project which others can use, by using the web pages directly on GitHub.com.  They don't include instructions for updating files locally from a sync'd repo on your machine.

### Creating the file
* Find the correct country code abbreviation for the bank your configuration file relates to.  See [country codes]: https://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/ctycodes.htm A2 column
* Log into GitHub and fork the project using the icon at the top right of the screen.  More info can be found here: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/
* From the forked repo select "__Create new File__"
* To create folders type "country code"/"bank name"/"default.json" e.g gb/monzo/default.json
* Then paste your .json file contents into the file window
* Type a commit title and message so the owner knows what benefits the change gives. i.e. new bank import config
* Select your account from the dropdown
* Select __Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request__
